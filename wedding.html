              <p>What could a wedding possibly have to do with UX? (I swear this isn’t just an excuse to show someone my wedding photos.) I really approached my wedding with a design mindset. It seemed natural to me. We were going to spend a decent chunk of money and time on this event, and I wanted to make sure we were prioritizing the right things.

          <div class="two-column">

              <p>The Aster Cafe can be described as a “Romantic eatery serving sandwiches & flatbreads, with skyline views & a summertime courtyard.” It’s this quaint little restaurant with a decent-sized event space. The Aster is full of charming details like stained glass, exposed brick, and hand-wrought iron work. It’s set on a historic street in Minneapolis right on the Mississippi River.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now the river is what I focused on. I’m no poet, but I really like the idea of a river as a metaphor for love and life - always changing and moving, smooth in some places and rocky in others (again I am not a poet). Plus the Mississippi is kind of a big deal and it starts in Minnesota.

          <h4>Branding Research</h4>
        <div class="two-column">
            <p>So as all brides-to-be do, I dug into some Mississippi River research. I was specifically interested in maps, which led me to Harold Fisk. If you don’t know who Harold Fisk is, he was a  geologist and cartographer working for the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1944. He was tasked with mapping the lower Mississippi River (i.e. not the part in Minnesota), both as it currently was in 1944 and how it had changed over past centuries. Rivers can move a lot which was news to me. Mr. Fisk beautifully illustrated this in these maps, using different colors to represent the river at different points in time.

        <div class="two-column">
          <img src="images/wedding/map.jpg" alt="Harold Fisk Map of the lower Mississippi"/>
          <p>Now like I said, these maps were of the lower Mississippi, but I loved the concept of these Fisk maps. Are they art? Are they really useful maps? Are they both? I decided I wanted to use this concept on our invitations that I was designing myself. So I created my own imagined versions of Fisk’s maps for the part of the Mississippi in Minnesota. This design was for the back of the invite. On the front I did a little illustration of the Aster Cafe and the neighboring buildings.

        <p>The colors on this invite (and therefore for the rest of the wedding) were inspired by the colors on a male pheasant. Not a lot of cool research here. Just that my husband and I both love birds and the male pheasant is a striking bird.

      <h4>The Online experience</h4>
    <div class="two-column">
        <p>While I was working on invitations, I was also working on our wedding website. I chose to use Appy Couple as our platform because it came with a really cool backend for managing rsvps as well as a tool for emailing guests. There is one particular thing I did with the website and guest communication that I want to call out and that’s a fun little concept I thought of called Guest of the week. We had a lot of guests who didn’t know each other and I wanted to bridge that gap as well as get people excited for the wedding. I had started picturing tables of strangers and felt there had to be a way to make our group of guests closer. A fun (and no cost) way to do this was to have the guests who wanted to fill out a questionnaire and then I would publish their answers in a weekly email newsletter, making them the “Guest of the Week”. It was a great way to engage people and I think people had fun with it.

      <h4>The in-person experience</h4>
    <div class="two-column">
        <p>Our wedding had a lot of the typical components of a wedding. We got married, we ate, we drank, and we danced. However, there was one thing we did that I felt really added to the experience in a unique way. I had seen that it had become a common practice to give your guests each a little thank you treat. In weddings I have been to I’ve gotten everything from a sticker to a little jar of jam. I struggled with deciding on what to do for our thank you gift. I didn’t want the cost of the gift to get out of control since we needed about 80 of them. I didn’t want it to be something nobody wanted just to check a box. Then I realized maybe I didn’t need to overthink this. What expresses thanks more than a thank you note? So I decided that Joe and I would write a little note for each guest for them at their place setting. Just a few words for everyone on why we appreciated them. It was actually a really grounding exercise for us and I think it really made the wedding experience more intimate and meaningful for every single guest.
