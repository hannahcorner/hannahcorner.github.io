    <section class="Problem">
      <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>The client asked me to create a cloud storage and organization product. This meant that I needed to design a cloud storage application with a definitive audience and clear branding. This product needed to fill a void, and I found that void to be a need for organizing and coordinating vacations and trips with multiple people.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="Solution">
      <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>Trippin allows travelers to store all their trip-related content. Users can find content related to trip activities, add it to a trip, and see what their fellow trip mates have added as well.</p>

    <section class="User-research">
      <h4>User research</h4>
        <p>I started off the process with a survey. I sent my survey to people that I know, but I made sure I sent it to a variety of ages and genders. I got 20 responses. Almost all survey participants had used a cloud storage product before. Many of them use more than one. Below is the breakdown for which products they use. Google Drive is the most used product, but Dropbox and iCloud are a close second. This tells me that most users are at least comfortable with the concept of cloud storage.</p>
        <img src="images/trippin/graph1.png" alt="bar graph showing what cloud storage products survey participants have used before"/>
        <p>I also asked about categories of content which received some interesting answers. People mostly wanted to store photos and documents. I got a very interesting write-in response though. Someone said they would want to store planning docs for vacation or budgeting. That could potentially encompass both documents and photos but have a clearer focus.</p>

    <section class="Competitive-analysis">
      <h4>Competitive analysis</h4>
        <p>As previously mentioned the competitive landscape for cloud storage has some very big players. I looked at Google Drive, Pinterest, and Evernote to get a better sense of what current players were doing in the space. Pinterest is a really great aspirational product, which is what I wanted for a cloud storage application for travelers since planning trips is inherently aspirational. Google Drive really has collaboration down, but obviously it requires everyone to have a Google account. Evernote is has super easy to understand notebook style format, but requires users to download the Evernote app.</p>

    <section class="Personas">
      <h4>Personas</h4>
        <p>I developed 2 personas for this project. You can think of them as the person that plans or even over-plans vacations and the person that is just sort of along for the ride. These people are different but both like traveling.</p>

    <section class="User-flows">
      <h4>User flows</h4>
        <p>I created three user flows to encompass user stories around logging in or creating an account, saving and storing travel-related content, and collaborating on trip planning with others. These flows represent all the functionality for the entire application.</p>

    <section class="Branding">
      <h4>Branding</h4>
        <p>What could be more cheery than a yellow sun? I wanted the logo to have a 1970s feel to match the name of the app. The font that goes with the logo is Montserrat. The semibold weight of the font matches the logo and the fact that it is sans serif keeps the look clean and crisp.</p>

    <section class="Usability-testing">
      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        <p>With the wireframes above, I conducted a first round of task-based usability testing. The test had four tasks and I did both remote and in-person tests. This resulted in four major changes to the wireframes. At this stage I also applied the branding to create higher fidelity mockups.</p>
        <h6>Start with “sign up” instead of “log in”</h6>
          <p>The first change was to start with the Sign Up page instead of a login page. Test participants commented that they would hardly ever need the log in page if they have their browser save their passwords.</p>
          <img src="images/trippin/usability1.png" alt="Trippin v1 log in screen"/>
          <img src="images/trippin/usability2.png" alt="Trippin v2 sign up screen"/>
        <h6>REMOVE THE username field</h6>
          <p>Next change came from many test participants being confused when they had to enter a username. Some people weren’t sure what contect the username would be visible in and we’re sure what was appropriate. Sticking with email and password simplified things and removed the source of confusion.</p>
          <img src="images/trippin/usability3.png" alt="Trippin v1 sign up screen"/>
          <img src="images/trippin/usability4.png" alt="Trippin v2 log in screen"/>
        <h6>Need a way to connect friends’ names to email address</h6>
          <p>Another change I made came from a test particpant asking how the application would know what email address belongs to what person. To remedy this I made the form in the Add a Trip Mate modal much more detailed.</p>
          <img src="images/trippin/usability5.png" alt="Trippin v1 add a trip mate modal"/>
          <img src="images/trippin/usability6.png" alt="Trippin v2 add a trip mate modal"/>
        <h6>Need a way to edit trip details and settings</h6>
          <p>The final change from task based testing was to add a way to edit the trip details if you needed. Initally I added a link to access the trip details</p>
          <img src="images/trippin/usability7.png" alt="Trippin v1 trip details screen"/>
          <img src="images/trippin/usability8.png" alt="Trippin v2 trip details screen"/>
        <p>I also did some preference testing using Usability Hub. The results led me to change the background of the  log in/sign up page and the access style to edit trip details.</p>
        <img src="images/trippin/usability2.png" alt="Trippin v2 sign up screen"/>
        <img src="images/trippin/usability10.png" alt="Trippin v3 sign up screen"/>
        <img src="images/trippin/usability11.png" alt="Trippin v2 trip details screen"/>
        <img src="images/trippin/usability12.png" alt="Trippin v3 trip details screen"/>
    </section>

    <section class="Final-iteration">
      <h4>Final iteration</h4>
      <p>I did a thid round of usability testing on the prototype with branding and made a few more tweeks, like making home feed feel less like advertisements and adding a new trip to the beginning of the list of trips, to arrive at the final version of the prototype.</p>

    <section class="Conclusion">
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>If I had more time, I would have loved to flush out more features. I got usability feedback about a ton of cool ideas for this application as well as having some of my own. I didn’t want to blow up the scope of this project though so I tried to keep things pretty simple.

The branding part of this experience was really interesting to me. I got feedback that the branding didn’t match up to what I was trying to emote so I had to learn what to tweak to make my branding more clear. At the end of the day, branding is all about communication.

It was a little daunting going into this project since cloud storage is a space where companies like Google and Amazon dominate. In the end though, I was able to design a product for a specific user and I think that’s almost always possible even in a competitive industry.</p>
